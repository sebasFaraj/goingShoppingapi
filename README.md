# Project Explanation

* This is a small project I plan on making over the course of a couple of days that is meant to help me get used to using the MERN stack
* The premise of the project is to create a mock online shop where a person is able to create a user and make "orders" with fake money
* I'll be commiting the progress I make each day until I'm eventually happy with the application
